  Well I want to. so here we go
Continuing convo from https://discord.com/channels/429657740562923521/429676012129746944/1158180681659187241

What is the Mariannas Web?
It is a "fictional" layer of the 'internet' that has following key points:
* Rumor: can only be accessed using "Polymeric Falcighol Derivation" which requires Quantum Computers
* Can't be / wasn't yet proven to exist

"Polymeric Falcighol Derivation":

I will call it out as bs, but the key point is that it requires a quantum computer.

Let's ask the question: What does it need a quantum computer for?
A quantum processor gives the ability to represent the values 0, 1 and values in between both with Qubits.
I'm not deep into Quantum computing, but I can abstract this concept and go further into the theory.

We have to options:
* Needing the quantum computers for computationally intensive tasks required to complete before / during sending network traffic on the Mariannas web
* Needing the quantum computers because data is sent as Qubits encoded on a cable

## Network
When we send network traffic, it will be represented by a change in voltage.
Here's a breakdown:
* For 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX, the data is usually carried on pairs 2 and 3 (often the blue and green pairs).
* When a '1' is sent, the voltage may transition from +2.5V to -2.5V on one wire of the pair, and from -2.5V to +2.5V on the other.
* When a '0' is sent, the voltage levels would remain constant at their last state, either +2.5V or -2.5V.
Bit encoding standard "PAM-5"

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_network#Quantum_internet>
> At present, there is no network connecting quantum processors, or quantum repeaters deployed outside a lab.
And that is basically the problem.
Since there is no standard, basically any network of Quantum computers that is under NDA and Top Secret restrictions would be "The Mariannas Web" wouldn't it?

Also, since all Routers on the internet use IP, Ethernet and so on, and encode their data as Bits on the cable, not Qubits, it would be simply IMPOSSIBLE that there is any "Hidden Network" INSIDE of the Internet that communicates with Qubits as Data Unit. It would require it's entirely own Protocol Stack that is not yet supported by any Routers on the internet.

## Computationally intensive tasks
This is the only way I see how it would make sense that there is a hidden network on the internet. It would be feasible and would be using Protocols we know to transfer the data, but the data would be encrypted with algorithms that are not publicly available and probably also not standardized.
In that case the Mariannas Web would be a layer of the internet, where people send data encrypted with their Quantum Computers down in their basement (cuz everyone has them right) and the communications would be perfectly visible, but the content impossible to see by todays standards.

Users for this type of network would be governments and highly, highly sophisticated organizations / criminal organizations.
The most secure government secrets would be transferred here and noone will be able to decrypt it for some decades.

They will most probably also use their own protocols above Layer 3, since Routers on the internet don't look further than that.
