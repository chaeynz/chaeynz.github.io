  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I recently found this very interesting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RFC3021<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It defines that a /31 subnet, which is a subnet with only 2 possible IP addresses, can be used for Point-to-Point connections
I am currently configuring a larger Hub-to-spoke VPN, which is why I instantly tried this out for addressing my tunnel interfaces</p>
<p>In this post I want to dive into a practical example</p>
<h1 id="why-does-a-31-subnet-mask-work-and-why-shouldnt-it">Why does a /31 subnet mask work and why shouldn&rsquo;t it?<a href="#why-does-a-31-subnet-mask-work-and-why-shouldnt-it" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<h2 id="why-shouldnt-it-work">Why shouldn&rsquo;t it work?<a href="#why-shouldnt-it-work" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In your typical day-to-day subnetting each subnet has a Broadcast address and a Network address
This could look like the following:
192.168.1.0/24
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Network Address: 192.168.0.0
Broadcast Address: 192.168.255.255</p>
<p>In this case the broadcast address can not be used on a host.</p>
<p>You see, these are usually untouchable and you can not assign a host with this IP address
Note: You could assign the address, but when trying to send traffic to this IP, it will send a broadcast, therefore receiving a broadcast as response, creating a loop</p>
<p>However, with a /31 subnet, there are only 2 possible addresses.
Let&rsquo;s look at a subnet with a /31 subnet mask:
Subnet Mask: 10.255.255.254
&ldquo;Network Address&rdquo;: 10.255.255.254
&ldquo;Broadcast Address&rdquo;: 10.255.255.255
In this case we <em><strong>would</strong></em> end up having a subnet with 0 possible host addresses. That makes no sense to create!</p>
<h2 id="why-does-it-work">Why does it work?<a href="#why-does-it-work" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at why RFC3021 works.</p>
<p>If a Host A and a Host B enters this /31 subnet &lsquo;10.255.255.254&rsquo; each will be able to send traffic to each other.
This makes sense, since it is obvious, that the only host they could potentially send a broadcast to <strong>is</strong> the other host.
A /31 subnet removes the need of a broadcast address.</p>
<p>This explains the broadcast address, now let&rsquo;s look at the Network address.</p>
<p>The RFC explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The network address itself {&lt;Network-number&gt;, 0} is an obsolete form of directed broadcast, but it may still be used by older hosts</p>
</blockquote>
